Friday night I was exhausted: we went from a fully functional bathroom the previous Saturday to a demolished, cleaned, plumbed, sub floored, and framed room in only a handful of days. I was up early again on Saturday, though, to meet one of the nicest guys I've had the privilege of knowing. Caleb is the husband of one of Julie's good friends, and he just so happens to be a sharp electrician.

We met at the house before the world was awake, sipped good coffee, fired up a healthy dose of California rock'n'roll, and re-wired the entire bathroom by the time the neighbors were starting their days. A heartfelt thanks to him for offering his early weekend morning to help us out.

Remnants of the old wiring.

Dear bathroom: meet your new friend, the fan. I think you'll get along swimmingly.

If you look at the back joist (the 'lower' one in the picture) as compared to the top, there's quite a difference in straightness, and it's not due to the camera lens. (This actually caused a bit of an issue when hanging drywall in the ceiling, but we'll cover that later.)

This doesn't have to do with wiring, but if you look at the joists, you can see shims that I ripped and attached between the top plate of the new wall and the old plaster portion of the ceiling. Drywall is thinner than plaster, and making up the difference is necessary in order to avoid obvious seams or lines on the finished surface. In theory, of course.
