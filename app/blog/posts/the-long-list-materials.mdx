Here are pictures of me and my dad loading materials after a careful and lengthy shopping spree.

*A heartfelt thanks to:*

-   *Our families for giving us so many Lowes and Home Depot gift cards over the holidays*
-   *Julie"s parents for the use of Desert Storm, their long bed Ford pickup truck*
-   *Victor Berg for offering much needed guidance on the long materials list*
-   *My dad for helping me load up at Home Depot*
-   *James Pickens and Rick Harris for helping me unload the materials into the shed late at night. Moisture resistant sheetrock isn"t light.*
