Today I had the chance to teach our Atlanta students the ropes of hunting for jobs in tech.

We covered everything from decoding developer job listings and keyword gaming to portfolio UI and freelance contracts.

It's always so exciting to see the light in their eyes when they think about applying the skills they are learning to a real product or job.

I love what I get to do everyday.

Tomorrow: Charleston.
