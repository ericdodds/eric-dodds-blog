I've had the privilege of attending Front End Design Conference[^1] was the last speaker and his talk was really well recieved.

Dan Denny[^2] has been a more-than-gracious host. Having run several conferences myself, I can say with confidence that this gathering is incredibly well-run and a joy to participate in.

More than smooth operations, though, Dan has gathered together a world-class group of developers and designers from the Tampa Bay area. I couldn't be more excited to run one of our code schools in the heart of the action.
