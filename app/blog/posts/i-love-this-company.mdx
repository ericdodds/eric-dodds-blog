Last week an internal email exchange came across my inbox that made me stop and smile. Sally Kingston[^1], our Campus Director in Charleston was working on a great plan to help several of our students through the job placement process after graduating. After sorting things out, she concluded the conversation by saying:

> I love this company. Empowering employees, caring about students, yet making money, too.

My business partner John recently pointed out that it's not the job of employees to tell leaders they are doing a good job[^2], and he's right. Seeing these comments come through from time to time, though, puts wind in the sails and affirms that the compass is pointed in the right direction.
