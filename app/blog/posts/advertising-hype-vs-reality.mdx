This week I had the pleasure of speaking at the Minnesota Interactive Marketing Association's yearly Summit[^1]. MIMA happens to be the oldest interactive marketing association in the US.

I've already learned great things from the smart people here, but one thing I *really* appreciate about some of the content is that it's honest. For example, in a session focused on the Internet of Things, Liz Presson[^2] said this:

> Technology isn't going to save your business.

That *felt* a little contradictory because her talk heralded the incredible ways in which physical devices connected to the Internet are literally changing entire businessesâ€”but she was spot on in her conviction. Using technology because it's there or simply because it's new and available (and popular) is a fool's errand. The best brushes won't make you an artist.

As another speaker, Dean Kamen[^3], said:

> The engine of technology is getting bigger and will continue to. But a bigger engine doesn't make a true difference unless the right person is behind the wheel.

In the face of the oppressive sensational advertising we face today, a breath of reality is refreshing.

*For contrast, an example of advertising hype:*
