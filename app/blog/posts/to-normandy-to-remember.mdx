*This is my grandfather, Herb Simmons, showing his medals to my wife.*

My grandfather, who I've written about before[^1], was a part of the valiant group of soldiers who entered France through the beaches of Normandy, helping reclaim the country from German forces. He is the only living member of his troop and in one week my wife and I will join him for the 70th anniversary of the 1944 D-Day Invasion.

In all the Battle of Normandy resulted in over 209,000 deaths of Allied troops (over half American)[^2]. To this day my grandfather can't talk about it without crying. I know that I can't imagine what that experience was like or feel the weight of sacrifice as deeply as him, but I know that he's thankful I haven't seen the things he's seen.

Thank you, grandpa. And thank you to all of the soldiers past and present who have selflessly faced the horrors war and death in hopes of peace.
