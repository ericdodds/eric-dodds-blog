Yesterday evening I flew into Portland, OR. It's been a few years since I'd flown over the Pacific Northwest and I'm always amazed at the breathtaking landscape—especially from the air.

I believe these mountains are Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Adams. The water, of course, is the mighty Columbia River.

Again, I *think* the mountains on the right side of this picture are Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Adams, but I'm not positive. As for the mountain on the left, my little bit of digging suggests it might be related to the Silver Star Scenic area. I'll investigate more deeply at some point, but for now, it's time to enjoy this beautiful city.
