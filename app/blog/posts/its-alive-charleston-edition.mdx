Tonight [John](http://twitter.com/saddington) and I joined the team in Charleston to celebrate the grand opening of our space.

We were humbled to be share conversation with several of the significant tech companies in the region, from Boomtown to PeopleMatter and Github.

Exciting times in the Holy City.
