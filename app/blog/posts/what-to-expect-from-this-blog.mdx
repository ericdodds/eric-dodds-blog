One truism that I harp on relentlessly focuses on expectations:

> All frustration is the result of unmet expectation.

Or, said another way, setting expectations well provides a great platform for relationship—to others, to work, to things we consume, to our time and so-on.

Recently I read a blog that I really enjoyed and the author did a very good job of explaining what his readers could expect in the about section. I really appreciated that because it gave me a context for evaluating how much time I wanted to invest in following and reading that author’s work. (As I’ve said before, we each have a limited number of precious hours to spend.)

I thought I’d take a cue from that experience and do the same thing here.

**What to expect from this blog**

In a one sentence summary, I’d say that the content published here reveals my thoughts and perspective on work and life (primarily work), the primary focus being things that I experience and learn along the way.

I currently run a fast-growing startup company and I’m obsessed with learning more about work-life balance in that context, working smarter, not harder, building company culture and growing as a leader. You can expect a healthy dose of reflection on those topics and more. My most recent effort is a series called [Making it Count](https://ericdodds.com/making-it-count-introduction/), and attempt to answer questions about how I get things done.

I’m a relentlessly curious person, so I’ll occasionally post articles in a category called Nerdery, where I’ll explore fun things like [airplane propellers](https://ericdodds.com/airplane-propellers-perfect-v1/), [user experience design](https://ericdodds.com/ux-fail-ice-cream/), or [great writing](https://ericdodds.com/pirate-site-of-sea/).

I’m a hack photographer and love taking photos of places I’ve been. Sometimes I’ll share a few pictures that I think are nice to look at (such as these from a [recent trip to Las Vegas](https://ericdodds.com/photos-las-vegas/)).

Occasionally I’ll post about non-work related “life" subjects (like [hunting for new budgeting software](https://ericdodds.com/budgeting-software-hunt/)), but those are fewer and farther in between.

Life is unpredictable, of course, so my focus could change, but I’ll set those expectations with whatever audience is listening if and when that time comes.
