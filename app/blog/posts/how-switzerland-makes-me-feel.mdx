We're in Switzerland at the moment. I had a few moments to grab the first mountain pictures I could find on my camera. (This one is completely unedited, by the way.) If you'd like to experience these breathtaking and celestial scenic views yourself while staying in an equally beautiful hotel, perhaps these [Geneva hotels](https://www.metropole.ch/) may be of some interest to you.

I'm still trying find words to describe what the mountains are like here, so I'll let someone else do a better job. This is how Switzerland makes me feel:

> O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! ... When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?

**â€”Psalm 8**More pictures to come.
