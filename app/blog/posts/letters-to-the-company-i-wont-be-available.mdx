I'm about to leave on an international trip with my family. I had told my company that I'd be available and working while on the trip, then realized that was poor leadership. So I wrote another letter. Here it is:

> Hey Team,
> 
> I'm sitting in the airport thinking about the amazing adventure I have in front of me. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience a hugely significant part of history with members of my family who likely won't live to have the experience again after this.
> 
> Then I thought about telling all of you that I'd be available and working while I'm on the trip.
> 
> And then I realized that was the worst living example I could give you for how I think you should spend time with your families and loved ones. If and when any one of you have a chance to spend meaningful time with your family, I want you to do just that—not letting the tension of email or HipChat or work calls dilute such an important experience.
> 
>For me to encourage you in that way and live opposite myself is hypocritical. I'm not perfect—none of us are—but I do want to live with integrity as a leader of this amazing company.
> 
> So, I won't be proactively available. I'm sure there will be times when we hop online to upload/share pictures, etc., but there will also be times where I completely disconnect so that I can fully experience what's right in front of me.
> 
> See you soon!
> 
> –Eric
