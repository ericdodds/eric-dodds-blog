I don't often post personal life updates, but I thought that producing offspring was a noteworthy event.

You can read more details (and check out lots of pictures) on a separate blog I set up[^1], but the short story is that he was born a happy, healthy baby with a head full of white-blonde hair. Mom is a champion and is doing very well. Contrary to what we were told would happen, we're actually quite well-restedâ€”we'll see how long that lasts, though.
