Andrew Dumont is an entrepreneur who works for betaworks[^1], a launchpad for great companies. I ran across his site the other day and part of his about section[^2] really resonated with me. This is exactly how I feel about my entrepreneurial adventures:

> I don't have any entrepreneurial fairytales to share about selling baseball cards on the playground or starting a billion dollar company out of a dorm room. And my resume is void of any big name consultancy, exit, or brand.

But, in spite all of these so-called shortcomings and failures, I've been able to make my way through the world of technology and entrepreneurship on a combination of moderate intelligence and pure grit.

â€”Andrew Dumont
