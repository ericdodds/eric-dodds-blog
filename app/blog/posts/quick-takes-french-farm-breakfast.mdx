We have been staying on a farm in Normandy and making trips to various monuments and battle sites in remember since of D-Day.

One of our favorite things about living on a farm has been the simple family breakfast. Everyone, including guests, gathers around the table and enjoys fresh French bread with butter and jam, yogurt, espresso/coffee and fresh cows milk...from that same morning.

We read the paper and talk about events as much as our poor French will allow, and listen to the family discuss news and work.

It is wonderful.
