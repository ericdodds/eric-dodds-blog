Last year my wife and I went on an adventure in the Northeastern US. Our first stop was the Franconia Range[^1] in New Hampshire's White Mountain National Forest[^2]. The terrain was simultaneously some of the most challenging and beautiful I've ever experienced. Fun fact: the highest surface wind speed observed by mankind (231mph) was recorded in 1934[^3] on Mount Washington, the highest peak in both the White Mountains and the Northeastern US.

Here are a few photos from our trip.

Weather changes dangerously fast in these hills.

Steep and rocky.

Note the small hut just under the rock face in the center of the picture.

The lakes of clouds were other-worldly.
