After the plumbing was finished last Monday, my dad and I took to the lumber and framed in the new wall. We gained 12 square feet, which sounds small, but makes a big difference relative to the original footprint.

We were able to get the sticks up in one night, and I spend the next two nights problem solving boxes for medicine cabinets, tie-ins for a shelf, and supports for the [wall-hung sink](/blog/heavier-iron-the-cast-iron-sink/). By Friday night, we had ourselves a completely framed-in room.

Old trusty. Wondering what the metal grating is? That's the heater. For the entire house.

If you look at the right side of the photo, you'll see the dining room door that we are closing off.

The finished wall.

Boxing in the medicine cabinets.

Victory. It was a long week.
