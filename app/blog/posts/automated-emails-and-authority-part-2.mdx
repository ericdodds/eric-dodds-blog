Last week I wrote a post about how one simple difference in email signatures in automated emails can make the difference between perceiving *authority* or just another email[^1].

A few days later I piloted yet another new application. This one is called Front App[^2], a tool designed to help teams manage support-type emails (i.e., support@theironyard.com).

Shortly after signing up, I received this message:

> Hi there,

My name is Mathilde. I’m one of the co-founders and the CEO of Front. I wanted to be the first to welcome you and your team on board.

Ok, it’s true that it's an automated email, but if you reply it comes directly to me and will be answered by me :)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or just to give me your first impression.

Thanks and welcome again. I’m excited you're giving Front a try!

Mathilde

Interestingly, it was a plain-text email, which I actually found to be more approachable than a fancy HTML message. I found it interesting, based on my previous post, that the CEO acknowledged up front that the email was automated—she said what recipients are thinking. But she followed that acknowledgement up with an encouragement to respond: "if you reply it comes directly to me and will be answered by me."

I'm surprised I don't see more plain-text emails like this. Most seem to be beautifully crafted, but I wonder if the conversion rate benefits from the extra time and work, especially if you can play on the authority of a CEO.
