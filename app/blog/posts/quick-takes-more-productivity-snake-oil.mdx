Yesterday I Tweeted about my blog post on what productivity snake-oil looks like[^1]. One of my good friends pointed me towards a great interview[^2] with a very successful blogger (Maria Popova of Brain Pickings), by a very successful personality (Tim Ferris).

I have an immense amount of admiration for Mr. Ferris and readily admit that he's been more prolific in the last few years than I have in my entire life. That being said, when I clicked the link to visit his site, the offer that popped up was classic productivity pr0n[^3]:

Again, with the utmost respect to Mr. Ferris—and the acknowledgement that well-designed apps can be extremely helpful—any intimation that more tool options will make you more productive smacks of snake-oil.

I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes, which comes from the film The Princess Bride:

> Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.
