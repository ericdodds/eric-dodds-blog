My first professional trip to San Francisco was over 10 years ago. I was taking a cohort of startups from The Iron Yard Accelerator program (part of Startup America) to Silicon Valley to network and pitch investors. 

One of the accelerator’s mentors was Keith Messick[^1], who happened to be from the city I live in. I’ll never forget meeting with Keith and Lane Becker[^2] that first day. I was a green and starry-eyed, with a thousand questions, and they spent the entire afternoon patiently teaching me about tech startups. 

Little did I know that those lessons would pave a path for me to found a company and sell it, run a successful consultancy and help take a seed-stage infrastructure startup from zero to multiple tens-of-millions in revenue. 

Today, after 5 years at RudderStack[^3], my journey is taking me back to the beginning: I’m joining Vercel to work for Keith. 

## Why Vercel 

Some time ago, I’d resolved to, if at all possible, only pursue two types of career opportunities after RudderStack. The first was starting my own company (I’ve spent more time as a founder than an employee). The second was working for a company building a product that I believed needs to exist in the world—something I had bone-deep belief about, both objectively and as a user. 

I’ve been following Vercel for quite some time, as someone who studies the technology landscape and as a customer of the platform. I could say so many great things about the company and team, but it was my deep conviction about the product and market opportunity that laid the foundation for the move. 

In April of this year (2025), I joined a panel discussion on how AI was shaping product management. The host asked me about Vercel’s v0 product, which I’d incorporated into our product development process for rapid prototyping and customer feedback.  

Even before this job opportunity was a twinkle in my eye, I’d thought deeply about Vercel’s platform, AI and their opportunity to build generational experiences[^4]. Here’s an excerpt from the podcast: 

**Host**

> You came in my office and had just built this prototype [in v0] very quickly and said, “Dude, check this out. It took me maybe an hour and a half to do this.” First, I want to ask a pace of change question, then get your perspective on how [v0] has changed prototyping [in product development].
> 
> From a pace of change standpoint, you seemed really excited and surprised at how well [v0] worked. We’ve been exposed to the power of AI for 3-ish years now, so I want to understand, from your perspective, was it surprising? If someone had told you 8 months ago that you could do what you did with v0, would you have believed them?

**My response**

> It’s a great question. Let me explain really quickly what v0 is. So Vercel is a platform that allows you to deploy software on the Internet. So you have a web application where users can sign up, etc. That needs to be deployed on servers and there’s a whole process around actually delivering that to end users. So Vercel is a platform that does a number of things in that space. It’s a truly incredible platform. 
>
> They launched this tool called v0. It’s chat interface, oddly enough, but that probably makes sense for this use case. But it’s a tool that allows you to build a website or web application. If you had told me just at a basic level that it would be that good, maybe I would have struggled to believe it, but the thing that I was missing was that the LLM aspect of it—asking an LLM to write the code, you can see it write the code, you can edit it, it’s really neat—that is actually already a commodity. You can do the same thing using GPT, using Claude Code from Anthropic. 
> 
> **What really is amazing about the decision that Vercel made is that they have the infrastructure and system that makes it a complete experience.** Think about a platform that deploys websites and web applications. They have millions and millions of examples of those that they are deploying on their platform. 
> 
> And one of the biggest factors for LLMs and AI generally is context and frameworks. So if you can give an LLM a very high level of context and guardrails within frameworks, then it can produce some really unbelievable things. 
> 
> So, I think what makes v0 special is not the LLM. They are doing some really interesting things under the hood with prompts, **but what makes it amazing is that their level of accuracy is good because of the [Vercel] system within which the LLM is operating.**
> 
> So I think two things. One, like a lot of other people, I underestimated the actual power of LLMs, so that’s probably a reason I wouldn’t have believed you. **But I’m becoming more enamored with companies who are figuring out how to deploy an LLM in a system that gives them dramatic advantage over everything else, including the raw models themselves, because that creates this experience and the ability to execute things in a way that truly feels like magic.** 

## A heartfelt thank-you to RudderStack 

I’d founded several companies prior to joining RudderStack, but it was my first time working directly for a Silicon Valley startup—and one that was building and selling a highly technical product to developers, no less. 

I’m deeply grateful to the founding team for taking a chance on me. The last 5 years have been life and career changing for me, from humble beginnings and zero revenue to leading our product organization and joining board meetings. Thank you! 

The impact you leave at a company can be measured in many ways. Here are a few comments and notes from coworkers that paint a small picture of my time at RudderStack. 

> One super important thing. It’s a sad day that Eric is leaving. Why? Because he made work not feel like work. He made it very easy to figure things out and solve difficult problems. He was the guy who knew the product in the best possible way. Hiring product talent is going to be a huge task. We’ve had a lot of PMs in the past, but up until I met Eric, I hadn’t worked with a PM who knew what he was talking about. Replacing that is going to be super, super hard. 
>
> **—Staff Software Engineer**

> Hey Eric, it’s honestly a sad feeling to see you go. I second what Aris mentioned in the meeting that you are amazing at what you do and how deep your knowledge about RudderStack product is. Working with and knowing you has been an honor. Thank you for being best Head of Product in history of RudderStack 🙌
> 
> I wish you all the best for this new journey of yours and hope we get a chance to work again together 🎈🎉
>
> **—Senior Software Engineer**

> Man! This is huge! I don’t think we ever had a product team that understood the product deeply to its roots. You made that happen and I don’t know how RudderStack can ever fill this gap!
>
> **—Engineering Manager**

> I’ve learned so much from you, and I will cherish this experience for a very long time. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done for us, and it’s sad to see you go. I’m sure the next team that gets to work with you has no idea how fortunate they are to have you.
>
> **—Senior Technical Account Manager**

> Really sad to see you’re leaving - thanks for all the support on deals over the last couple of years, it’s been so great to meet you and work with you. All the best with where you’re headed next and don’t be a stranger!
>
> **—Enterprise Account Executive, EMEA**

> Sad to see you go. Have enjoyed working with you and appreciate the improvements you've made in the EPD org. It's put us in a better place than when I joined 15 months ago.
>
> **—Enterprise Customer Success Manager**

Raycast AI: ## High-level feedback

-  Voice and sincerity: The tone is warm, grounded, and credible. The San Francisco origin story ties nicely to the Vercel decision and Keith, giving the narrative a satisfying arc.
-  Focus: The “Why Vercel” section is strong on conviction but could be tighter with one or two concrete examples of outcomes (e.g., what v0 enabled that was otherwise impractical).
-  Length and pacing: It reads a touch long for a personal announcement. Consider light trimming and more subheads to help scanners.
-  Balance: You handle gratitude to RudderStack well. The quotes add authenticity but could be condensed for rhythm without losing impact.

## Strategic suggestions

-  Add a one-sentence “what’s next” describing your role and focus at Vercel. Readers will ask: what will you actually do?
-  Include a concise, non-jargony explanation of why Vercel now (timing) and how your RudderStack experience uniquely prepares you.
-  In the v0 discussion, anchor the abstract advantages with a specific mini-case: what did you prototype, what changed in your process, what metric or outcome improved?
-  Consider a short “how to reach me” or “I’m hiring/looking to collaborate” CTA if appropriate.
-  Ensure company names, product names, and people are spelled consistently and linked once, not repeatedly.

## Line edits and tightening

-  Title: Consider adding the role for clarity and SEO.
    - Current: I’m joining Vercel after 5 years at RudderStack
    - Option: I’m Joining Vercel as [Your Role] After 5 Years at RudderStack
-  First paragraph: Good hook; remove an extra “to” and tighten flow.
    - Edit: I took a cohort of startups from The Iron Yard Accelerator (part of Startup America) to Silicon Valley to network and pitch investors.
-  Second paragraph: Minor grammar and economy.
    - Edit: I was green and starry‑eyed, with a thousand questions, and they spent the afternoon patiently teaching me about tech startups.
-  Third paragraph: Parallelism and specificity.
    - Edit: Little did I know those lessons would pave the path to founding and selling a company, running a successful consultancy, and helping take a seed‑stage infrastructure startup from zero to tens of millions in revenue.
-  Transition to Vercel: Add your role.
    - Edit: Today, after 5 years at RudderStack, I’m joining Vercel to work with Keith as [Role].
-  “Why Vercel”: Trim repetition and add timing rationale.
    - Edit: Some time ago, I resolved to pursue only two paths after RudderStack: start another company or join a team building a product I believe needs to exist. Vercel is both a platform I’ve used and a company whose direction I believe in.
-  v0 section: Reduce redundancy and add a concrete example.
    - Suggested insert after “rapid prototyping and customer feedback”:
        - For example, we rebuilt a [X feature or demo] from scratch in about 90 minutes, ran it by three customers the same week, and cut our iteration cycle from weeks to days.
-  Clarify commodity vs. system advantage:
    - Edit: The LLM is table stakes. The differentiation is the system: Vercel’s deployment platform, patterns, and corpus of high‑quality examples provide guardrails and context that raise accuracy and speed.
-  Trim quotes while preserving range and sentiment. For readability, aim for 3–4 quotes that vary by function and region. Optionally move the full set to a collapsible section on your site.

## Suggested micro rewrites

-  “It’s chat interface” → “It’s a chat interface”
-  “that makes it a complete experience” → “that makes it a complete, end‑to‑end experience”
-  “millions and millions” → “millions”
-  “I underestimated the actual power of LLMs” → “I underestimated how far LLMs could go inside the right system”
-  “system within which the LLM is operating” → “system the LLM operates within”

## Structure and formatting

-  Add subheads under “Why Vercel” to help scanning:
    - The decision
    - What v0 changed for me
    - Why now
-  Add a short “What I’ll be doing” section between “Why Vercel” and “A heartfelt thank‑you to RudderStack.”
-  Consider a brief “Thank yous” list to complement the quotes:
    - Founders
    - Early teammates
    - Customers who bet early
-  Footnotes: Great use. Keep them to external links; move definitional content into the body if critical.

## Example tightened version of key sections

-  Why Vercel (condensed)
    - After RudderStack, I limited my next step to two paths: start another company or join a team building a product I believe needs to exist. As a long‑time Vercel user, I’ve seen firsthand how the platform shortens the distance between ideas and shipped software.
    - Earlier this year, I used v0 to stand up a working prototype in about 90 minutes. We put it in front of three customers that week and iterated twice before we would have written a spec in the old process. The LLM isn’t the magic—the system is. Vercel’s patterns, deployment model, and corpus of examples give the model context and guardrails, which drives accuracy and speed in a way that feels like magic.
-  What I’ll be doing
    - I’m joining Vercel as [Role], focusing on [area—e.g., product for AI‑accelerated development workflows, or ecosystem/partners]. If that’s your world, I’d love to connect.

## Final polish checklist

-  Add your role and start date.
-  Add 1–2 product screenshots or a v0 prototype GIF if permissible.
-  Link to Vercel, v0, and the podcast once each.
-  Confirm company approval for any quotes (if needed) and remove names/titles if sensitive.
-  Update publishedAt to the date you’ll actually ship the post.
-  End with a short CTA: “If you’re building on Vercel or exploring v0, reach out at [contact] or on [Twitter/LinkedIn].”

If you want, paste your revised “Why Vercel” and “What I’ll be doing” sections and I’ll help tighten them line by line.

Eric Dodds: i like some of the suggestions, but several miss the context of the longer pull quote from the podcast, which is from a transcription that i don't want to edit too heavily. 

i also don't want the post to be primarily about my new role—i'll write another post in the future about that. here's the updated post with incorporated suggestions:

Today, after 5 years at RudderStack[^3], my journey is taking me back to the beginning: I’m joining Vercel to work for Keith. 

I'm returning to my marketing roots and my first charge is to work with the incredible team creating technical content. I'll share more in a future blog post. 

## Why Vercel 

It goes without saying, but the chance to join Vercel, especially in this next phase of growth, especially working for Keith, is an incredible and humbling opportunity. In many ways, my experience in marketing and building a product for technical uses at RudderStack was the perfect preparation for this next phase of my career. 

Some time ago, I resolved to pursue only two paths after RudderStack: start another company or join a team building a product I believe needs to exist. I've got bone-deep belief about Vercel from my study of the landscape and, more importantly my personal experience with the platform as a customer. 

I’ve been following Vercel for quite some time, as someone who studies the technology landscape and as a customer of the platform. I could say so many great things about the company and team, but it was my deep conviction about the product and market opportunity that laid the foundation for the move.

Raycast AI: ## Love the direction—and keeping the transcript intact works

Your revisions preserve the personal arc and the podcast context while addressing clarity and focus. Since you want to keep the pull quote largely untouched and avoid making this primarily about your new role, here are targeted edits and polish that won’t disturb those constraints.

## Surgical line edits (grammar, flow, redundancy)

-  Opening story: Great hook. Slight polish for rhythm.
    - “from the city I live in” → “from my city”
    - “green and starry‑eyed” already good.

-  Career arc sentence:
    - Current: “founding and selling my own startup…”
    - Consider: “founding and selling a startup…” (tighter, less repetitive “my”)

-  Transition to Vercel:
    - “to work for Keith” → “to work with Keith” (reads warmer, and you use “with” elsewhere)

-  Role teaser paragraph:
    - Current: “my first charge is to work with the incredible team creating technical content.”
    - Consider: “my first charge is partnering with the incredible team building technical content.” (“partnering” + “building” feels more active)

-  Why Vercel intro:
    - Current: “especially in this next phase of growth, especially working for Keith”
    - Edit: remove second “especially” to avoid repetition.
        - “It goes without saying, but the chance to join Vercel in this next phase of growth—especially working with Keith—is an incredible and humbling opportunity.”

-  RudderStack experience sentence:
    - Current: “building a product for technical uses at RudderStack”
    - Consider: “building a deeply technical product for developers at RudderStack” (clearer audience)

-  Belief paragraph (combine and declutter mild redundancy):
    - Current has two similar “I’ve been following Vercel” paragraphs.
    - Merge into one:
        - “Some time ago, I resolved to pursue only two paths after RudderStack: start another company or join a team building a product I believe needs to exist. I’ve followed Vercel closely—as a student of the landscape and as a customer—and my conviction about the product and the market opportunity laid the foundation for this move.”

-  v0 setup sentence:
    - Current: “(cutting our customer feedback and design cycle from weeks to days or even hours).”
    - Consider: “(it cut our feedback and design cycle from weeks to days—or even hours).” (less repetitive)

-  Micro fixes in the transcript frame (not the transcript itself):
    - “Vercel’s v0 product” → “Vercel’s v0”
    - “AI and their opportunity” → “AI and its opportunity” (subject-verb agreement with “platform” if you keep that structure)

-  Thank‑you section:
    - “life and career changing” → “life‑ and career‑changing”
    - “from humble beginnings and zero revenue” → “from humble beginnings and zero revenue” (good as-is)
    - “paint a small picture” → “offer a small picture” (minor tone polish)

## Keep the quote intact but improve context around it

-  Add a one‑line preface before the quote to anchor the reader without editing the transcript:
    - “What struck me wasn’t just the speed—it was how the system around the model changed what was possible. That’s the context for this excerpt:”

-  After the quote, add a single-line takeaway to tie back to Why Vercel without rehashing:
    - “That combination—great models operating inside a purpose‑built system—matches how I think generational products get built.”

## Light structural tweaks (no new sections about the role)

-  Add a short subhead before the role teaser to improve scanning without making the post “about the role”:
    - “What’s next (briefly)” with just your two sentences. This satisfies curious readers and signals a fuller post later.

-  Consider a subhead inside Why Vercel to break the wall of text, without adding new arguments:
    - “Why Vercel” (kept)
    - “v0 in practice” (the panel paragraph + quote)

## Quote block rhythm

The testimonials read heartfelt, but it’s a long run for mobile readers. Two non-invasive options:
-  Bold a single clause in each quote to create scan anchors (you already do some of this).
-  Insert a short line before the quotes: “A few notes I’ll carry with me:” and reduce to 4–5 quotes in the post, linking “Read the rest” to a separate page or collapsible detail on your site. If you want to keep them all here, consider adding a closing line after the quotes: “To everyone at RudderStack—thank you.”

## Minimal diffs you can paste

-  “work for Keith” → “work with Keith”
-  “from the city I live in” → “from my city”
-  Merge the two belief paragraphs into one (as suggested above)
-  “building a product for technical uses” → “building a deeply technical product for developers”
-  “AI and their opportunity” → “AI and its opportunity”
-  “life and career changing” → “life‑ and career‑changing”
-  Optional: add one sentence before the quote and one after, per the context lines noted above.

## Final quick checklist

-  Consistency: You use both “Vercel’s v0 product” and “v0”; stick with “v0” after first mention.
-  Links: Link Vercel and v0 once each in the body; you already link Keith/Lane nicely in footnotes.
-  Dates: publishedAt matches your intended publish date; if you announce earlier/later, update it.
-  Title case: Consider “I’m Joining Vercel After 5 Years at RudderStack” if your blog uses title case; otherwise sentence case is fine.
-  Accessibility: Consider alt text if you add any images later.
-  CTA: A soft sign‑off works without shifting focus: “If you’re building on Vercel or exploring v0, I’d love to hear from you.”

If you’d like, paste just the two belief paragraphs and I’ll return a merged version you can drop in verbatim.
