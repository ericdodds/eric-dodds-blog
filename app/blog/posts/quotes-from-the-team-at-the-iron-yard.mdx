Over the last few weeks I've been culling through a gigantic pile of links, articles and ideas that I've saved up for this blog. One of the files contained quotes from team members at The Iron Yard (the company I help lead). I'm not exactly sure who said what or when, but I do know that I copied them from Slack or other internal tools.

Seeing how people feel about working at The Iron Yard everyday reminded me of how thankful I am to be a part of the company. There are lots of incredible people I rub shoulders with everyday as we do important workâ€”that's not something I want to take for granted.

> Just caught a typo -- put "journey" instead of "journal." Then realized...that's exactly how working at TIY feels. Definitely the first time I've been in a job that felt from the outset more like a journey than anything else.

> I can say with confidence and conviction that this job is the best one I've ever had. The rewards are plentiful and the atmosphere and attitude of all involved make it a pleasure to ride the train in everyday.

> Here's to many more years of growth, both individually and as a group!

> We 3 campus folk had our first heart to heart/everything on the table talk last week in the thick of planning. I'm very thankful to be surrounded by people who respect each other, who all care about our purpose, and who are willing to be vulnerable. Dishing things out (which sounds much stronger than the situation called for) was very helpful in getting things done and letting out tension. Awesome, onward, and upward.

> It's been such an awesome week - I totally understand the feeling of 'I can't believe I get paid to do this'. It's a great feeling to see students succeed on their knowledge and assignments!"

> I really like this job, this group, and this company. This week was tough, tiring, energizing and a hell of a lot of fun.
