Email subscriptions are one of my nemeses. I am a serial un-subscriber and instantly remove myself from 99% of mailing lists (more on that in another post).

I've been trying out a new budgeting product recently[^1] and in the process of signing up my email address was added to their mailing list. I happen to like the product and was surprised at my lack of hate for their mass emails. That lack of hate was quickly diminished when I received too many messages too quickly, which almost subconsciously forced my cursor to the unsubscribe trigger.

Most of the time email subscriptions and the like are a forced "yes" or "no"—either you get our content on our schedule, or you don't. There aren't options.

This time I was given a set of choices for how often I'd like to be contacted. I'd found value in the product and some value in the content of their emails, so I decided that I'd actually like to receive some of that information, but only once a month.

The company maintained a line of communication with me that they wouldn't have if my only options were "yes" or "no."

Smart stuff. When wielded correctly, the act of giving customers options can be powerful.
