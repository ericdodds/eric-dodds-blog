Ladies and gentlemen, I present you with the remodeled bathroom.

Thanks for following along!

The wide angle lens definitely makes the room look larger, but to give you an idea of the size I started with, the original wall would have been between the two mirrors. Yes, it was very, very small.

We couldn't be more happy with the sink (you can read more about it [here](http://dontwaitfor.us/heavier-iron-the-cast-iron-sink/)). Two people can get ready very comfortably.

Perhaps the best part about the sink is the illusion of spaciousness that it gives when you walk in. The tile naturally draws your eyes across the floor, and being able to see more square footage (as opposed to a vanity cabinet front) makes the space feel roomy.

Another choice we made was to run the beadboard from floor to ceiling. Generally people put wainscoting 4-5 feet up the wall and break it with chair rail. Since there is so little open wall space, we thought that breaking vertical lines would work against us by making the space feel more busy and cramped. It worked wonderfully - the continuous lines along the tile and up the walls maintain a clean, spacious feel.

It was actually extremely difficult to take a clean shot at this angle without myself in it. The lens was at 10mm, I was standing on my tip-toes holding the camera in the corner of the walls and ceiling, and it took about 40 shots of trial and error to get the positioning just right. (Also, I stepped on the LCD screen of our scale, and broke it. I promptly told my wife that I just broke the scale. We haven't gotten another one, so tell me if I start to fill out.)

The sink had two mounting brackets cast into the mold. A few trips to home goods stores to find the right toilet paper hanger, and another trip to Home Depot for some hardware, and we had ourselves a custom toilet paper holder tucked perfectly under the sink.

Storage. High five!

We came a long, long way.

The built-in cabinet worked out marvelously, and there's more storage space than we use.

Again, we've come a long, long way.
