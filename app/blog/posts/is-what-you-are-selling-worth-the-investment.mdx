Recently a potential customer (who is now a customer) asked a question about our business on Quora[^1]:

> Is The Iron Yard Academy worth the investment?

I like that question because it cuts directly to the question behind every question a customer asks: *Is what you'd provide me worth more than the money I'd give you?* The concept of value exchange is one of the foundations of commerce. We give people and companies money because they can accomplish or provide something for us that we can't/don't have time to/don't want to do ourselves.

That's a healthy way to evaluate what we do: **how much value do we provide our customers relative to the amount of money they give us**?
