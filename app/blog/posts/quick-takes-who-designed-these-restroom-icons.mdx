I found these icons above the aft lavatory on a Delta flight to Houston.

I'm not a designer, but everyone who I've shared this picture with responds with some variant of the question, "is the thing on the right supposed to be an electrical outlet?" No, that's a popsicle hanging out with Tarzan in a bathroom.

The sign performs its job, so it's hard to call it a failure, but I'm not sure I would have let this out the door.
