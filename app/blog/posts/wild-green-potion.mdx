We were given a juicer recently and I now consume wild green concoctions almost every day. My wife prepares them and I try to guess the ingredients.

I'm no health junky, but apparently you still glean most of the nutrients in fruits and vegetables just from the juice (you miss out on the fiber). That means one cup contains far more good stuff than a single serving if either.

Interesting stuff.
