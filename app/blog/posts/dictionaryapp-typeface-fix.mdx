It's the little things.

I recently posted about OS X's typeface in Dictionary.app.[^1] In short, all text was displaying as the same bold font, creating no hierarchy to help the reader parse content visually.

Before writing the post, I did my homework and discovered I wasn't alone. Other people were experiencing the same issue. Here's a screenshot from Nathan Spainhour's computer:

Also, a gentleman named Matt Stein commented on my post lamenting the same issue on his computer and proposing a possible hack-y solution:

Thankfully, he added an update to his comment with a link to a fix.[^2] It turns out that if you're experiencing this issue, it's likely that the Baskerville Regular typeface is disabled, as someone in the Apple Discussion forums pointed out.[^3]

I checked computers of a few more people at the office and our anecdotal study suggestions that the problem happens for people who have 3rd-party font management software installed.

Dear Internet (and Matt Stein), thank you for being awesome.
