Recently I was working with one of our teams to distribute pre-work for classes at The Iron Yard. One of our instructors ([Matt Keas](https://twitter.com/matthiasak)) included the following in his message to incoming students:

> Hey IronYardians!
> 
> I’m so excited to get started and meet as a group! As a precursor to our class, I have some “pre-work” for our class. Eric, Brian, and myself will email everyone a few more times as our starting date arrives. I am very excited and extremely grateful that each of you has **invited us here at The Iron Yard to share your story**. I am pumped and ready to rock. (*Emphasis mine.*)

What a wonderful perspective and reminder: we as the business have the privilege of being invited into our customers' stories (not the other way around). Whenever I have the opportunity to speak in front of students at The Iron Yard, I always make sure to thank them for trusting us and believing we can help them make a difference—after all, they didn't *have* to choose us. We have an opportunity to make their life better. In our context, we have an opportunity to help them completely change their life—that's not something to take lightly.

I think on some level this is a philosophical perspective: do I view my interactions with customers as more of a privilege or a right? It's easy for me to look at the value I think we're providing and wonder why someone *wouldn't* do business with us, but that's a fertile ground for unhealthy ego.

On one of the flights I took today one of the attendants said, "Thanks for flying with us today. We know you have choices and the fact that you chose us means a whole lot." That could certainly be lip service, but the attitude towards the customer is on target.
