The second stop on our Northeastern tour found us in Acadia National Park[^1]. We stayed on both the Shoodic Peninsula[^2] and Mount Desert Island[^3] sides of the park and found the Schoodic area to be much quieter and less touristy.

Fun fact: The highest point in Acadia, Cadillac Mountain, is named forÂ Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, a French explorer[^4]. Along with leaving his namesake in Maine, he helped found the city of Detroit in the early 1700s. An automobile manufacturer honored the effort in 1902 by naming their firm "Cadillac" and using de La Mothe's coat of arms as their logo.

Here are a few photos from the hills.

The intersection of mountain and sea in Acadia is extraordinary.

We missed the show, unfortunately.
