The last 5 days have been quite a blitzkrieg of work. We started demolition on Saturday afternoon and had the entire footprint completely gutted in 24 hours. (For the record, I also taught children's church on Sunday morning. After the long night of work I didn't understand anything I said to the kids, and I don't think they did either.)

A special thanks to Vicky and Matt Hammond for letting us borrow amazing tools of destruction, crushing through plaster, and helping us make quick work of the old cast iron tub with a sledge hammer. Interestingly, "The Hammer" happens to be Matt's nickname at his job, but we'll let him tell you that story.

Here are a few pictures of the demolition process. Re-construction is underway, and updates are coming soon.

We plan to re-use this same door jamb, so we were careful when prying it out.

It was time.

We found several layers of beautiful linoleum. Ahem.

One slight tug on the channel locks and the drain crumbled like a hollywood marriage.

Still looks small.

With a bit of careful prying, the existing tile came loose in clean, carry-able sheets.
