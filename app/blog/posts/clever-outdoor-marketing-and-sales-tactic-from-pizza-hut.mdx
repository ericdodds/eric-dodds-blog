If you've ever attended a large event in a non-traditional event venue, you know that obtaining food and beverage can sometimes be a challenge.

I was visiting a friend in Brussels, Belgium today and we walked by a pop-up film festival on a large sidewalk area in front of a building. It was late and the kitchens in many restaurants were closed.

There was a bar on the corner behind the seating, so people were drinking, but my friend told me that the bar has very few food options. That's when we spotted a bright red door (complete with doorbell) with a Pizza Hut "delivery point" sign and phone number.

On the back of the door was a menu and instructions.

The right product in the right place at the right time, in the form of an unmistakable bright red object.

Simple and smartâ€”often the characteristics of great marketing.
