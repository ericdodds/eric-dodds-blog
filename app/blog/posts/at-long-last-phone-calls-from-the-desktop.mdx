I participated in the Apple Beta program for OS X Yosemite. Along with a developer preview of iOS 8, you can now make and recieve calls from your desktop. This has been possible for some time via Gmail’s Chat[^1], but both the interface and masked number aren’t ideal.

BluePhone Elite was a solution for a while, but it went through a period of not supporting the iPhone[^2] and isn’t available anymore (as far as I can tell).

Even in Beta, which has been relatively smooth for me, Apple has done a marvelous job of connecting the calling features of iPhone to the desktop.

It’s a simple thing, but I’ve long desired the convenience of a fluid connection between my phone and computer.

[^2]: Here’s [a thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2412343?start=0&tstart=0)lamenting the lack of support for BluePhone Elite. Apparently it worked for a while (see [this article),](http://smokingapples.com/software/reviews/bluephoneelite-finally-supports-the-iphone/) but a majority of searching reveals complaining about lack of support.
