I'm in Durham for a few days laughing our first code school in North Carolina. We are partnered with a company called Smashing Boxes, and getting to know them has been a privilege.

Walking through their office the other day, I overheard a developer and a designer discussing a project. One if them said, "look, the goal of this entire process is to make the user happy."

We are in good company.

Ellen, Joel, and Josh hacking on code school ideas. Great team.
