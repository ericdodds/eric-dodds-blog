In 2014 I wrote about the problem of 'quantity perception' that many online reading interfaces present. Here's an excerpt:

> Many formats (or interfaces) through which online copy is delivered make judging the *amount* of content difficult. Simply put, indicators of quantity (or length) are vague and inconsistent. In many cases, the *scroll bar* is our most commonly available point of reference...

I feel largely the same way as I did in 2014—most online reading interfaces obscure quantity from the audience (some intentionally so). Instapaper has become much more helpful, showing both the amount of estimated reading time as well as reading time remaining for articles you haven't finished. Still, they are beholden to the scrollbar for feedback on progress while reading.

One site that has surprised me repeatedly with their online reading experience is Bloomberg. While they still rely heavily on distracting, clickbait-ish techniques, they do a great job of subtly, but clearly showing the reader how far they have progressed through the article. Good stuff.

*Unfortunately, the human brain isn't designed to watch video and read at the same time[^1], so Bloomberg is decreasing the reader's ability to consume the content, but hey, progress is progress.*
