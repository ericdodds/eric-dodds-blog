# Eric Dodds Weblog

This is my personal website. It hosts my blog posts, tells readers a bit about me and have a contact form for people who want to reach out. 

## Migration from WordPress

I the site on WordPress for years, then finally bit the bullet and migrated it into a super snappy Next.js app on Vercel. 

I [wrote a blog post](https://www.ericdodds.com/blog/migrating-my-wordpress-blog-to-nextjs-and-vercel?utm_source=github-blog-repo) about the migration. 

## If you want to clone my site

I used the [Vercel Portfolio Blog Starter](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) template and made modifications in style and functionality. I was careful to not do anything weird to keep the baseline Next.js app clean (including removal of the code and scripts used for the WordPress migration). 

You should be able to clone this repo and get the app running pretty easily.
