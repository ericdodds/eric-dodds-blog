Every single time I open the program, I’m surprised at the typeface and treatment chosen for normal body text.

The typeface is Baskerville, in bold weight, for almost every hierarchy of text in an entry—an unfortunate visual experience for the user. I’d love to know the reasoning, or lack thereof, behind this choice. I asked my close friend John Saddington[^2], who develops apps for Mac and knows more about Apple than anyone I know, what he thought and his response was, “Apple probably doesn’t care about that app.”

I agree, but it is a bit disappointing to see the devil in the details at such a design-centric company. Either that or I’m the only one still using Dictionary.app, which is the more likely case.

**Nerd bonus**

For the workflow nerds out there, Alfred (a Spotlight-replacing search tool for OS X) has Dictionary support built in. Simply open Alfred with your shortcut and type “define”, then the word you want to look up, and enjoy lightening-quick access to the definition.
