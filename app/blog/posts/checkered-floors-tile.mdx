The final coats of paint on the ceiling and bead board were just dry when Ben and I started in on the tile this past Thursday. As usual, Ben showed me the ropes and we moved very quickly laying the new floor.

Other than running out of thin set and prolonging the project to two days instead of one, everything went incredibly smoothly. We were shocked by how little tile we had leftover - literally any less wouldn"t have been enough. Also, it just so happened that waste from cutting the 12x12 sheets on one end of the room fit perfectly to make up space on another wall. In Ben"s words, "This just doesn"t happen. Ridiculous." Once the mortar cures, I"ll grout, and then the real fun begins.

The best part of the process was seeing Julie light up when  she saw the tile.

The master, showing me how to lay out the room.

Yours truly, learning on the job. Tile isn"t so difficult, but I highly recommend recruiting someone who can show you which mistakes to avoid.

Straighter lines than I expected. Now it's completed, I can justify buying new floor cleaning products. A friend recommended [Bissell](https://www.bissell.com/vacuums/robotic-vacuums) products to me.
