I’m in North Carolina for the official launch of one of our code schools[^1]. I’m sitting in a completely silent student work room with one of our instructors, and even though the environment would normally be the epitome of calm, an undercurrent of energy is swirling through the entire place.

I think that feeling is here because there’s something electric about an empty container that’s about to produce mountains of awesome.

That feeling doesn’t get old. Tomorrow this place will be filled with people who possess unbelievable potential and will go on to change their lives and careers and accomplish amazing things—and I’m enjoying every moment of super-charged anticipation.
