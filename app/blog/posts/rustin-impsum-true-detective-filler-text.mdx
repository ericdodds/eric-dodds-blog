I recently ran across a project called Rustin Ipsum, which was built by an Iron Yard student in Washington, D.C. Scott Ross, the creator, explains his motivation[^1] (warning: if you haven't seen True Detective, this won't be as fun.):

> There are plenty of Lorem Ipsum generators out there, but I couldnâ€™t find any channeling that contemporary spirit of post-modern despair so perfectly captured in True Detective.

There was only one obvious course: build my own Rust Cohle Lorem Ipsum generator.

For a weekend project after two weeks of class, the result is very impressive[^2] Enjoy some auto-generated filler text:

*World needs bad men. We keep the other bad men from the door. Sip Lone Star. This place is like somebody's memory of a town, and the memory is fading. It's like there was never anything here but jungle. Drag on Camel.*

Great work, Scott. I'll be using this often.
