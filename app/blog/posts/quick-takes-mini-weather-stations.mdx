Recently I had a job placement meeting with a student named Todd. He's in his late 40s.

The beginning of class was a bit rough, and at a few points I think he questioned whether he was going to make it.

Low and behold, weeks later he had more than persevered: his final project consisted of miniature Arduino weather stations and an [open source API](http://heidenreich.github.io/nwAPI/) anyone can use to track climates in their office space.

His favorite part?

"People came to ask 'the old guy' questions. That made me happy."

Todd's API hard at work.
