This week a friend[^1] emailed me and shared a few extremely encouraging words with me. He pointed to an article by Fred Wilson[^2] and said, "this reminded me of TIY in general. I think this has a lot to do with your growth."

Here's a quote from the article:

> So its conventional wisdom that being nice is a bad idea in business.
>
>I have found otherwise. I have found that reputation is the magnet that brings opportunities to you time and time again. I have found that being nice builds your reputation. I have found that leaving money on the table, and being generous, pays dividends.
>
> I am not saying you should be overly generous or nice to a fault. There's a limit to everything. But I do think that thinking about others, and trying to make things right for everyone (which is impossible and will drive you crazy) is an approach that pays off in business.
>
> It's not the fastest way to make a buck. It takes time. But it is way more sustainable than screwing people over.

Fred's words have proven true for The Iron Yard. Every time I see our teams interacting with our students, the level of empathy and deep care is astounding.
