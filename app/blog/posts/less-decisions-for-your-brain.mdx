Last night my wife and I were folding laundry. We had two loads to process, so I started on one while she took care of a few other chores around the house.

We've been married a few years, but don't often do laundry togetherâ€”we both do the laundry, it's just that most often it's a solo activity no matter who is doing it (my wife is wedding florist and works weekends, which is why our schedule is a little out of the ordinary).

When my wife came in to help fold the clothes she asked, "do you always separate all of the clothes into piles before folding them?" I didn't think much about it, but that's exactly what I'd done: I sorted all of the clean clothes into piles by category (socks, shirts, etc.) and then set about folding them. Of course, I was asked to explain my methodology.

As is often the case with things we do but don't analyze, the process of dissecting our rationale can be fascinating. I mulled over my reasoning and came to the conclusion that most likely the way I think about work has seeped into the way I think about other tasks as well, namely the idea that giving your brain more decisions to make than necessary slows you down.

I admit that this entire concept is rather trivial in the context of folding laundry, but the implications are interesting enough to explore the thought.

Earlier this year I wrote about why I use footnotes[^1]. In that post I mentioned a quote from Rolf Dobelli about our brains making decisions (the quote discusses how our modern news system is distracting):

> In a 2001 study two scholars in Canada showed that comprehension declines as the number of hyperlinks in a document increases. Why? Because whenever a link appears, your brain has to at least make the choice not to click, which in itself is distracting. News is an intentional interruption system.Although I didn't specifically plan the process, I sub-consciously created a workflow where similar decisions and activities would be grouped together so that decision-making was streamlined. Said another way, you're only asking your brain to make one *type* of decision at a time. First: which pile does this go into? Next, it's almost mindless process for each pile because you're performing the same action (like folding a shirt) repeatedly.

As I said above, folding laundry is a funny example (and I have no idea if my method is actually more efficient), but I think the concept is important for anything I'm working on: **am I creating an unnecessary bloat of decisions for my brain by grouping many *different* or *unrelated* decisions and tasks together at the same time?**

I'm a huge fan of focusing on one task at a time (as I wrote about in my post about time, attention and technology[^2]). In fact, I think wrangling focus is the difference between people who throw *time* at their work to accomplish huge amounts of work and those who are able to accomplish just as much in a lesser number of hours.
