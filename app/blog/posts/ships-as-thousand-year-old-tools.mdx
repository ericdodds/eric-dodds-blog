I'm in Charleston helping launch the first round of Academy classes. Amidst the craziness of last minute preparations, my wife and I stole a few moments to run out to Sullivan's Island for a walk by the waves.

As we arrived a huge barge was entering the harbor, and when we left another was leaving.
