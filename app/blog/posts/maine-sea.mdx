> The second stop on our Northeastern tour found us in Acadia National Park[^1]. We stayed on both the Shoodic Peninsula[^2] and Mount Desert Island[^3] sides of the park and found the Schoodic area to be much quieter and less touristy.

I posted photos of Acadia's mountains previously[^4], but that was only half the story. Maritime heritage is the true treasure of Maine's coastline. I recommend steering clear of Bar Harbor and retreating to active fishing towns like Bass Harbor[^5], which we found to be quaint, full of history, and a great way to access offshore islands.

Fun fact: Bass Harbor was once haphazardly named McKinley, after President William McKinley. At the turn of the 20th century, federal officers asked what they should name the village's newly built post office. Someone in their company told them to "name it after the president, for all we care." And they did. The town carried the same name until citizens petitioned to have it changed in 1961.
