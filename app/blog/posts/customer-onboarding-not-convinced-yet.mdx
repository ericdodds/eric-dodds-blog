I recently transitioned our company to a new project management tool called Teamwork. During the on-boarding process, I noticed a really great marketing mechanism: a button that asked, “Not convinced yet?” 

It’s a simple question, but it caught me off guard because it felt more honest than other calls-to-action that I’ve seen (Start today! Get your first month free!). Teamwork anticipated the state I was in—the process of being convinced—and made accessing relative content incredibly easy. 

Well done.
