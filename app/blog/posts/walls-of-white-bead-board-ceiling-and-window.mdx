Progress is a funny thing. Everything we accomplished up to finishing sheetrock was great, but much of the time it didn"t *feel* like leaps and bounds were being made. It felt more like we were pouring hours and hours into the same-looking construction zone.

Putting bead board up, finishing the ceiling, and replacing the window changed everything. Each hour of labor made the worksite look more like a finished water closet. Next job I think might be to purchase some shutters for all my windows from a place like [Shuttercraft](https://www.shuttercraft-warwick.co.uk/).

The 7 days between hanging drywall and having finished walls and ceiling were quite a blur of work, and fairly taxing on my sleep schedule. We"re cooking with gas now, though, and next up is tile.

Extra-special thanks are due to Eric Whitlock for helping hang breadboard on the three largest walls (and letting me borrow his nail-set), my dad for tackling the seam in the ceiling with the first two rounds of mud (and doing a mighty fine job that, with some careful sanding and feathering, made for a near-perfect finish), and my brother-in-law Ben, for his ever-perfect measurements.

I found this Porter-Cable 150psi [buy viagra online](http://www.ovationtv.com/scheduledata/index.html) compressor (and hose) at a roadside garage sale for $40, just days before we were going to hang bead board. I had heard my dad constantly complain about his cheap, stubborn, and inconsistent compressor, so I gave the find to him as a gift. Of course, he let me borrow it for my project.

First sheet up. Starting to look like a bathroom.

Man or giant? Whitlock nail setting the first seam.

Ceiling mudded and sanded.

My beautiful (and hard-working) fianc√©e, rolling on the first swaths of paint.

Old window removed. God provided us a summer-esque evening to work in.

Making a giant hole in the side of your house is a strange feeling. Also, windows are far easier to replace than you"d think.

A new window was worth not having to re-glaze this fossil.

So fresh and so...good at actually keeping heat and cool inside the house.

The new window and the finished walls.
