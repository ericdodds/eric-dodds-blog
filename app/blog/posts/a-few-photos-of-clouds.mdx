It's been quite a while since I picked up my camera. I used to be an avid photographer, but the backlog of photos to process became so oppressive that I lost motivation to shoot when faced with the idea of adding more to the pile. Leading up to a recent addition to our family, though, I spent a few months chipping away at thousands and thousands of photos, knowing that there was a huge amount of pending demand from mothers-in-law for cute baby pictures.

It's been fun to take pictures again. Just the other night I went out onto our porch and the clouds were a stunning contrast of color. I grabbed my camera and snapped a few shots, then tinkered around with a few different edits in Lightroom (a program I'm still learning). *If, for some reason, you'd like the full-res versions (for a desktop background, etc.), you can [download the full-res photos in a .zip file](http://ericdodds.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/616b8-ericdodds-clouds-desktop-backgrounds-august-2016.zip).*

Volcano in the sky.
