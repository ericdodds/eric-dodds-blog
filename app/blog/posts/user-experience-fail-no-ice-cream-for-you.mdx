It's hard to call any machine that gives you ice cream a failure, but this one is about as close as they come. (Your product shouldn't need Sharpie scrawled all over it just to be useable).

*And yes, that red dot is an infrared sensor that keeps the machine from operating unless it is covered with precision.*
